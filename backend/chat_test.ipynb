      "1. **Situation 1: The execution of a conditional jump instruction** - This can cause a control hazard. The CPU may fetch instructions after the jump instruction before it knows whether the jump will be taken or not. If the jump is taken, these instructions will be invalid and need to be discarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Situation 2: The (i+1)th instruction uses the result of the ith instruction as an operand** - This can cause a data hazard. The (i+1)th instruction may try to use the result of the ith instruction before it is available, resulting in incorrect results.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Situation 3: The (i+1)th and ith instructions require the ALU at the same time** - This can cause a structural hazard. Since there is only one ALU, it cannot be used by two instructions at the same time, resulting in a conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all three situations can cause hazards in a pipelined CPU.\n"
